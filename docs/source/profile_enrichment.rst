Input tables must be a table containing a column for sequences, counts before selection
and counts after selection.

Example Input Table::


    seq    ct_0    ct_1
    GAPY   10      34
    APFY   30      10
    ...

Example Output Table::

    pos   le_A    le_C ...
    0     .1      -.2
    1     .4      -.3
    ...

The analysis can be run using the command::

   sortseq profile_enrichment -i selected_library.txt

Where selected_library.txt is the file containing your input table.
