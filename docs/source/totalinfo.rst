Overview
-------------
``totalinfo`` is a program within the sortseq_tools package which calculates
the mutual information between gene expression and knowledge of the entire sequence.
This should be run on a sublibrary, which is a typical experiment, only run with 
only 200-300 unique sequences. The mutual information calculated represents the 
maximum amount of information acheivable by any model.

After you install `sortseq_tools`_, this program will be available to run at the command line.
